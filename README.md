## App Streaming

The **App Streaming* project is still a Proof of Concept.

Once the project will be mature, it will be split into several repositories. Meanwhile, it's more convenient to work on a single repository.

More information can be found in the [docs/ folder](docs/). Feel free to join the `#app-streaming` Slack channel.

The main folders are:

- [app/app-ethereum/](app/app-ethereum/)
- [app/app-rust/](app/app-rust/): app written in Rust. The app builds successfully and that's all.
- [app/sdk/](app/sdk/)
- [vm/](vm/): Nano RISC-V VM app
- [host/](host/): tools to interact with the VM app
